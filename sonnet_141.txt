# Sonnet 141 - William Shakespeare

In faith, I do not _verb_ thee with mine _body part (plural)_.
For they in thee _number_ _noun (plural)_ note,
But 'tis my _body part_ that loves what they _verb_,
Who in despite of view is _verb ending in "ed"_ to _verb_.

Nor are mine _body part (plural)_ with thy tongue's _noun_ delighted,
Nor _adjective_ feeling, to base _noun (plural)_ prone,
Nor taste, nor smell, _verb_ to be _verb ending in "ed"_
To any _adjective_ _event_ with thee alone:

But my five _noun (plural)_ nor my _number_ senses can
Dissuade one foolish _body part_ from _verb ending in "ing"_ thee,
Who leaves _verb ending in "ed"_ the likeness of a _animal_,
Thy proud heart's _occupation_ and _occupation_ to be:

Only my _illness_ thus far I count my gain,
That she that makes me _verb_ awards me _noun_.
