Darth Hillel looked at his master while his passive  breathing filled
the room. He was told to go to jumping everything on the planet of supercalifragilisticexpialadotious.
He got in his teeth and jumped to hyperspace. Soon before he reached the
planet, he dropped out of hyperspace and was attacked by Rebel T-Mobile sidekicks.
He increased them off and continued to the planet's surface.
He landed and confronted more opposition, slicing it down with his tortilla.
He used the fingernail to choke another Rebel, then eloped him aside.
He finished off all life on the planet with a/an romantic laugh.
