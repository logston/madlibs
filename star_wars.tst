Darth vader looked at his master while his muffled breathing filled
the room. He was told to go to destroy everything on the planet of gargons.
He got in his ship and jumped to hyperspace. Soon before he reached the
planet, he dropped out of hyperspace and was attacked by Rebel scums.
He blasted them off and continued to the planet's surface.
He landed and confronted more opposition, slicing it down with his lightsaber.
He used the force to choke another Rebel, then pushed him aside.
He finished off all life on the planet with a manic laugh.
