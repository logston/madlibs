# Pride and Prejudice

My _noun_  will not be repressed. You must allow me to _verb_ you how
ardently I _verb_ and love you. In declaring myself thus I'm aware
that I will be going expressly against the _noun (plural)_ of my family,
my _noun (plural)_, and, I hardly need add, my own better judgement.
The relative situation of our _noun (plural)_ makes any alliance
between us a reprehensible connection. As a rational _noun_ I cannot
but regard it as such myself, but it cannot be _verb ending in "ed"_.
Almost from the _adjective_ moments, I have come to feel for _person_ ...

... a _adjective_ admiration and _emotion_, which despite my struggles,
has _verb ending in "ed"_ every rational _noun_. I _verb_ you, most
fervently, to _verb_ my suffering and consent to be my _noun_. In such
cases as these, I believe the established mode is to _verb_ a sense of
_emotion_. But I cannot. I have never _verb ending in "ed"_ your good
_noun_, and you have certainly bestowed it most _adverb_. I'm sorry to
cause _noun_ to anyone, but it was _adverb_ done, and I hope will be
of short _noun_. And this is all the reply I am to expect?
I might wonder why, with so little effort at civility,
I am _verb ending in "ed"_.
