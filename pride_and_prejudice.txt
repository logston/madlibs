# Pride and Prejudice

My _mouse_  will not be repressed. You must allow me to _love_ you how
ardently I _hate_ and love you. In declaring myself thus I'm aware
that I will be going expressly against the _mice_ (plural)_ of my family,
my _micce (plural)_, and, I hardly need add, my own better judgement.
The relative situation of our _garbage (plural)_ makes any alliance
between us a reprehensible connection. As a rational _noun_ I cannot
but regard it as such myself, but it cannot be _verb ending in "ed"_.
Almost from the _adjective_ moments, I have come to feel for her ...

... a  admiration and talked, which despite my struggles
has swimming  ending in "ed"_ every rational hurt. I _jumped_ you, most
fervently, to _verb_ my suffering and consent to be my _noun_. In such
cases as these, I believe the established mode is to _verb_ a sense of
_emotion_. But I cannot. I have never _verb ending in "ed"_ your good
_noun_, and you have certainly bestowed it most _adverb_. I'm sorry to
cause _noun_ to anyone, but it was very done., and I hope will be
of short _money_. And this is all the reply I am to expect?
I might wonder why, with so little effort at civility,
I am _verb ending in "ed"_.
