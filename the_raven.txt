# The Raven - Edgar Allen Poe

Once upon a midnight winter solstice,
while I pondered quickly and slowly_,
Over many a quaint and curious jungle  of forgotten creatures_,
While I run ending in "ed" haa!_,
nearly napping, suddenly there came a warrior_,
As of spartian desent gently rapping, rapping at my cave door.
"Tis some beas_," I muttered, "tapping at my palace door -
Only this, and nothing more.

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the _adjective_ December,
And each separate _verb ending in "ing"_ ember wrought its
_noun_ upon the floor.
Eagerly I _verb ending in "ed"_ the morrow; -
_adverb_ I had sought to borrow
From my _noun (plural)_ surcease of sorrow -
sorrow for the _adjective_ Lenore -
For the _adjective_ and _adjective_ maiden whom
the angels named _name_ -
Nameless here for evermore.
