# The Raven - Edgar Allen Poe

Once upon a midnight _adjective_,
while I pondered _adjective_ and _adjective_,
Over many a quaint and curious _noun_ of forgotten _noun_,
While I _verb ending in "ed"_,
nearly napping, suddenly there came a _noun_,
As of _noun_ gently rapping, rapping at my _place_ door.
"Tis some _noun_," I muttered, "tapping at my _place_ door -
Only this, and nothing more.

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the _adjective_ December,
And each separate _verb ending in "ing"_ ember wrought its
_noun_ upon the floor.
Eagerly I _verb ending in "ed"_ the morrow; -
_adverb_ I had sought to borrow
From my _noun (plural)_ surcease of sorrow -
sorrow for the _adjective_ Lenore -
For the _adjective_ and _adjective_ maiden whom
the angels named _name_ -
Nameless here for evermore.
