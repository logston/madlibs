After _adjective_ years in exile for a crime he didn't _verb_,
_name_ now Sweeney Todd, returns to _city_ to find his _noun_ dead and
his daughter in the _body part (plural)_ of the evil _occupation_ Turpin.
In his anger, Sweeney goes on a _adjective_ rampage on all _city_,
with the help of Mrs. Lovett, he opens a _occupation_ shop in which he lures
his victims in with a charming _noun_ before _adverb_ ending their
life with a _verb_ of his razor across their _body part_. But not one
_noun_ killed, nor _seven__ men can satisfy Sweeney's lust for revenge
on those who've caused his years of pain.
